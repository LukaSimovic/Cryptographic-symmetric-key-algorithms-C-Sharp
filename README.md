# Cryptographic-symmetric-key-algorithms-C-Sharp
Encryption and decryption using symmetric-key substitution and transposition algorithms implemented as C# Windows Form application.

Code is in "AlgoritmiZastita" folder (files: Form1.cs, Form2.cs).
The view of the GUI is given as images and it is in "Examples" folder.

The differences compared to the [last project](https://github.com/LukaSimovic/Cryptographic-symmetric-key-algorithms) are:

1. This is C# Windows Form application
2. Transposition algorithms have been added (Rail Fence algorithm and Row Transposition algorithm)
3. Combinations of algorithms are possible (multi-encryption and multi-decryption)
